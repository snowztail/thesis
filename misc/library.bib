	abstract  = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) that enables the control of wireless propagation environment has recently emerged as a promising cost-effective technology for boosting the spectrum and energy efficiency in future wireless communication systems. Prior works on IRS are mainly based on the ideal phase shift model assuming the full signal reflection by each of the elements regardless of its phase shift, which, however, is practically difficult to realize. In contrast, we propose in this paper the practical phase shift model that captures the phase-dependent amplitude variation in the element-wise reflection coefficient. Based on the proposed model and considering an IRS-aided multiuser system with an IRS deployed to assist in the downlink communications from a multi-antenna access point (AP) to multiple single-antenna users, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the total transmit power at the AP by jointly designing the AP transmit beamforming and the IRS reflect beamforming, subject to the users' individual signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints. Iterative algorithms are proposed to find suboptimal solutions to this problem efficiently by utilizing the alternating optimization (AO) or penalty-based optimization technique. Moreover, we analyze the asymptotic performance loss of the IRS-aided system that employs practical phase shifters but assumes the ideal phase shift model for beamforming optimization, as the number of IRS elements goes to infinity. Simulation results unveil substantial performance gains achieved by the proposed beamforming optimization based on the practical phase shift model as compared to the conventional ideal model.},

This paper proposes a Riemannian geometry approach for optimization of a real-valued cost function J of complex-valued matrix argument W, under the constraint that W is an n × n unitary matrix. We derive steepest descent (SD) algorithms on the Lie group of unitary matrices U(n). The proposed algorithms move towards the optimum along the geodesics, but other alternatives are also considered. We also address the computational complexity and the numerical stability issues considering both the geodesic and the nongeodesic SD algorithms. Armijo step size [1] adaptation rule is used similarly to [2], but with reduced complexity. The theoretical results are validated by computer simulations. The proposed algorithms are applied to blind source separation in MIMO systems by using the joint diagonalization approach [3].

	abstract = {The intent of this paper is to provide an overview of basic concepts, types, techniques, and experimental studies of the current state-of-the-art Frequency Selective Surfaces (FSSs). FSS is a periodic surface with identical two-dimensional arrays of elements arranged on a dielectric substrate. An incoming plane wave will either be transmitted (passband) or reflected back (stopband), completely or partially, depending on the nature of array element. This occurs when the frequency of electromagnetic (EM) wave matches with the resonant frequency of the FSS elements. Therefore, an FSS is capable of passing or blocking the EM waves of certain range of frequencies in the free space; consequently, identified as spatial filters. Nowadays, FSSs have been studied comprehensively and huge growth is perceived in the field of its designing and implementation for different practical applications at frequency ranges of microwave to optical. In this review article, we illustrate the recent researches on different categories of FSSs based on structure design, array element used, and applications. We also focus on theoretical breakthroughs with fabrication techniques, experimental verifications of design examples as well as prospects and challenges, especially in the microwave regime. We emphasize their significant performance parameters, particularly focusing on how advancement in this field could facilitate innovation in advanced electromagnetics.},

While both types of IRS can attenuate the amplitude and change the phase of a reflected electromagnetic wave, active IRSs are also capable of amplifying the wave. We derive inner and outer bounds for the DoF region and lower and upper bounds for the sum DoF of the K-user interference channel in the presence of an active IRS and prove that the maximum value of K for the sum DoF can be achieved if the number of IRS elements exceeds a certain finite value. The analysis framework developed for active IRSs forms the basis for our analysis of passive IRS-assisted systems. In particular, we present probabilistic inner and outer bounds for the DoF region and probabilistic lower and upper bounds for the sum DoF of the K-user interference channel in the presence of a passive IRS and prove that the lower bound for the sum DoF asymptotically approaches K as the number of IRS elements grows large.},

	abstract  = {We consider a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel in the presence of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). Specifically, our focus is on analyzing the spatial multiplexing gains in line-of-sight and low-scattering MIMO channels in the near field. We prove that the channel capacity is achieved by diagonalizing the end-to-end transmitter-RIS-receiver channel, and applying the water-filling power allocation to the ordered product of the singular values of the transmitter-RIS and RIS-receiver channels. The obtained capacity-achieving solution requires an RIS with a non-diagonal matrix of reflection coefficients. Under the assumption of nearly-passive RIS, that is, no power amplification is needed at the RIS, the water-filling power allocation is necessary only at the transmitter. We refer to this design of RIS as a linear, nearly-passive, reconfigurable electromagnetic object (EMO). In addition, we introduce a closed-form and low-complexity design for RIS, whose matrix of reflection coefficients is diagonal with unit-modulus entries. The reflection coefficients are given by the product of two focusing functions: one steering the RIS-aided signal towards the mid-point of the MIMO transmitter and one steering the RIS-aided signal towards the mid-point of the MIMO receiver. We prove that this solution is exact in line-of-sight channels under the paraxial setup. With the aid of extensive numerical simulations in line-of-sight (free-space) channels, we show that the proposed approach offers performance (rate and degrees of freedom) close to that obtained by numerically solving non-convex optimization problems at a high computational complexity. Also, we show that it provides performance close to that achieved by the EMO (non-diagonal RIS) in most of the considered case studies.},

	abstract = {The future of mobile communications looks exciting with the potential new use cases and challenging requirements of future 6th generation (6G) and beyond wireless networks. Since the beginning of the modern era of wireless communications, the propagation medium has been perceived as a randomly behaving entity between the transmitter and the receiver, which degrades the quality of the received signal due to the uncontrollable interactions of the transmitted radio waves with the surrounding objects. The recent advent of reconflgurable intelligent surfaces in wireless communications enables, on the other hand, network operators to control the scattering, reflection, and refraction characteristics of the radiowaves, by overcoming the negative effects of natural wireless propagation. Recent results have revealed that reconflgurable intelligent surfaces can effectively control the wavefront, e.g., the phase, amplitude, frequency, and even polarization, of the impinging signals without the need of complex decoding, encoding, and radio frequency processing operations. Motivated by the potential of this emerging technology, the present article is aimed to provide the readers with a detailed overview and historical perspective on state-of-the-art solutions, and to elaborate on the fundamental differences with other technologies, the most important open research issues to tackle, and the reasons why the use of reconflgurable intelligent surfaces necessitates to rethink the communication-theoretic models currently employed in wireless networks. This article also explores theoretical performance limits of reconflgurable intelligent surface-assisted communication systems using mathematical techniques and elaborates on the potential use cases of intelligent surfaces in 6G and beyond wireless networks.},

	abstract  = {Transmission through reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), which control the reflection/scattering characteristics of incident waves in a deliberate manner to enhance the signal quality at the receiver, appears as a promising candidate for future wireless communication systems. In this paper, we bring the concept of RIS-assisted communications to the realm of index modulation (IM) by proposing RIS-space shift keying (RIS-SSK) and RIS-spatial modulation (RIS-SM) schemes. These two schemes are realized through not only intelligent reflection of the incoming signals to improve the reception but also utilization of the IM principle for the indices of multiple receive antennas in a clever way to improve the spectral efficiency. Maximum energy-based suboptimal (greedy) and exhaustive search-based optimal (maximum likelihood) detectors of the proposed RIS-SSK/SM schemes are formulated and a unified framework is presented for the derivation of their theoretical average bit error probability. Extensive computer simulation results are provided to assess the potential of RIS-assisted IM schemes as well as to verify our theoretical derivations. Our findings also reveal that RIS-based IM, which enables high data rates with remarkably low error rates, can become a potential candidate for future wireless communication systems in the context of beyond multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) solutions.},

A modern mathematical proof is not very different from a modern machine, or a modern test setup: the simple fundamental principles are hidden and almost invisible under a mass of technical details. Hermann Weyl A long-standing problem in linear algebra-Alfred Horn's conjecture on eigenval-ues of sums of Hermitian matrices-has been solved recently. The solution appeared in two papers, one by Alexander Klyachko [20] in 1998 and the other by Allen Knut-son and Terence Tao [23] in 1999. This has been followed by a flurry of activity that has brought to the mathematical centre-stage what for many years had been somewhat of a side-show. The aim of this article is to describe the problem, its origins, some of the early work on it, and some ideas that have gone into its solution. A substantial part of this article should be accessible to anyone who has had a second course on linear algebra. The reader who wants to know more will find it rewarding to read the comprehensive and advanced account [11] by William Fulton. 1. LINEARITY, QUASILINEARITY, AND CONVEXITY The principal characters in our story are n × n Hermitian matrices A and B, their sum C = A + B, and the eigenvalues of A, B, and C enumerated as α 1 ≥ α 2 ≥ · · · ≥ α n , β 1 ≥ β 2 ≥ · · · ≥ β n , and γ 1 ≥ γ 2 ≥ · · · ≥ γ n , respectively. Sometimes we would like to emphasize the dependence of the eigenvalues on the matrix. We then use the notation λ ↓ j (A) for the jth eigenvalue of A when the eigenvalues are arranged in a (weakly) decreasing order. Thus α j = λ ↓ j (A). This n-tuple of eigenvalues of A as a whole is denoted by α or λ ↓ (A). The story begins with a simple question: what are the relationships between α, β, and γ ? Now, the eigenvalues are not linear functions of A and no simple relation between α, β, and γ is apparent, except one. The trace of A, denoted tr A is the sum of the diagonal entries of A and also of the eigenvalues of A. So, tr C = tr A + tr B and hence n j=1},

Recently developed solution methods can solve even large-scale GPs extremely efficiently and reliably; at the same time a number of practical problems, particularly in circuit design, have been found to be equivalent to (or well approximated by) GPs. Putting these two together, we get effective solutions for the practical problems. The basic approach in GP modeling is to attempt to express a practical problem, such as an engineering analysis or design problem, in GP format. In the best case, this formulation is exact; when this is not possible, we settle for an approximate formulation. This tutorial paper collects together in one place the basic background material needed to do GP modeling. We start with the basic definitions and facts, and some methods used to transform problems into GP format. We show how to recognize functions and problems compatible with GP, and how to approximate functions or data in a form compatible with GP (when this is possible). We give some simple and representative examples, and also describe some common extensions of GP, along with methods for solving (or approximately solving) them. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007.},

	abstract  = {Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) is intended to supplant legacy (optical) bar code scanning technology found in many logistic and retail applications. RFID is distinguished by inexpensive, low power and compact form factor tags, whose longevity and efficacy are predicated on using passive communication techniques and on-tag power harvesting. Such tags employ backscatter modulation, which does not require any active RF components. As a result, backscatter has become an attractive design choice for short-range communications in power constrained wireless sensor networking scenarios. The purpose of this work is two-fold. First, it aims to expose backscatter communication as an emerging topic to a communication systems-theoretic audience. Since backscatter modulation and on-tag power harvesting efficiency are coupled, it is necessary to re-examine notions of power and spectral efficiency from an energy-constraint perspective; this leads to novel coded modulation schemes for future RFID systems. Further, we investigate RFID MIMO systems where the channel fading encountered has different statistics than the classical Rayleigh fading model.

In the literature, it is claimed that for elementary MACs, i.e., MACs for which the size of output alphabet is greater or equal to the sizes of all input alphabets, the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions provide a necessary and sufficient condition for sum-rate optimality. In this paper, we demonstrate that this claim does not hold, even for two-user channels with binary input and binary output alphabets.

	abstract = {The computation of the channel capacity of discrete memoryless channels is a convex problem that can be efficiently solved using the Arimoto-Blahut (AB) iterative algorithm. However, the extension of this algorithm to the computation of capacity regions of multiterminal networks is not straightforward since it gives rise to non-convex problems. In this context, the AB algorithm has only been successfully extended to the calculation of the sum-capacity of the discrete memoryless multiple-access channel (DMAC). Thus, the computation of the whole capacity region still requires the use of computationally demanding search methods. In this paper, we first give an alternative reformulation of the capacity region of the DMAC which condenses all the nonconvexities of the problem into a single rank-one constraint. Then, we propose efficient methods to compute outer and inner bounds on the capacity region of the two-user DMAC by solving a relaxed version of the problem and projecting its solution onto the original feasible set. Targeting numerical results, we first take a randomization approach. Focusing on analytical results, we study projection via minimum divergence, which amounts to the marginalization of the relaxed solution. In this case we derive sufficient conditions and necessary and sufficient conditions for the bounds to be tight. Furthermore, we are able to show that the class of channels for which the marginalization bounds match exactly the capacity region includes all the two-user binaryinput deterministic DMACs as well as other non-deterministic channels. In general, however, both methods are able to compute very tight bounds as shown for various examples.},

Specifically, we assume that transmitters and receivers use M antennas each, and the channel matrix between each transmitter and each receiver has rank L2 whereas the channel matrix between each transmitter or each receiver and the RIS has rank L1, where L1, L2≤ M. In the absence of the RIS, the multiplexing gain from MIMO is severely limited when L2 is small. We develop a novel cooperative transmission technique utilizing the RIS to overcome the channel rank deficiency and manage inter-user interference, and the key idea is to neutralize interfering links using signals reflected from the RIS or to reflect incident waves at the RIS to increase the rank of effective channel matrices, depending on the system configuration parameters. We analyze the achievable sum degrees of freedom (DoF) and sum rate, and derive an upper bound on the sum DoF, which is tight under certain conditions. The results show that using an active RIS can significantly improve both the sum rate and sum DoF compared to the network without the RIS, especially when L1 is small and/or L2 is large.},

We also start to understand why, in addition to how, GP can be applied to a surprisingly wide range of problems in communication systems. These applications have in turn spurred new research activities on GP, especially generalizations of GP formulations and development of distributed algorithms to solve GP in a network.

	abstract      = {Far-field Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) has attracted significant attention in recent years. Despite the rapid progress, the emphasis of the research community in the last decade has remained largely concentrated on improving the design of energy harvester (so-called rectenna) and has left aside the effect of transmitter design. In this paper, we study the design of transmit waveform so as to enhance the dc power at the output of the rectenna. We derive a tractable model of the nonlinearity of the rectenna and compare with a linear model conventionally used in the literature. We then use those models to design novel multisine waveforms that are adaptive to the channel state information (CSI). Interestingly, while the linear model favours narrowband transmission with all the power allocated to a single frequency, the nonlinear model favours a power allocation over multiple frequencies. Through realistic simulations, waveforms designed based on the nonlinear model are shown to provide significant gains (in terms of harvested dc power) over those designed based on the linear model and over nonadaptive waveforms. We also compute analytically the theoretical scaling laws of the harvested energy for various waveforms as a function of the number of sinewaves and transmit antennas. Those scaling laws highlight the benefits of CSI knowledge at the transmitter in WPT and of a WPT design based on a nonlinear rectenna model over a linear model. Results also motivate the study of a promising architecture relying on large-scale multisine multiantenna waveforms for WPT. As a final note, results stress the importance of modeling and accounting for the nonlinearity of the rectenna in any system design involving wireless power.},

	abstract = {We study the effect of channel fading in wireless power transfer (WPT) and show that fading enhances the RF-to-DC conversion efficiency of nonlinear RF energy harvesters. We then develop a new form of signal design for WPT, denoted as transmit diversity, that relies on multiple dumb antennas at the transmitter to induce fast fluctuations of the wireless channel. Those fluctuations boost the RF-to-DC conversion efficiency thanks to the energy harvester nonlinearity. In contrast with (energy) beamforming, transmit diversity does not rely on channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) and does not increase the average power at the energy harvester input, even though it still enhances the overall end-to-end power transfer efficiency. Transmit diversity is also combined with recently developed (energy) waveform and modulation to provide further enhancements. The efficacy of the scheme is analyzed using physics-based and curve fitting-based nonlinear models of the energy harvester and demonstrated using circuit simulations, prototyping and experimentation. Measurements with two transmit antennas reveal gains of 50% in harvested DC power over a single transmit antenna setup. The work (again) highlights the crucial role played by the harvester nonlinearity and demonstrates that multiple transmit antennas can be beneficial to WPT even in the absence of CSIT.},

In this paper, we depart from this linear model and design WIPT considering the rectifier nonlinearity. We develop a tractable model of the rectifier nonlinearity that is flexible enough to cope with general multicarrier modulated input waveforms. Leveraging that model, we motivate and introduce a novel WIPT architecture relying on the superposition of multicarrier unmodulated and modulated waveforms at the transmitter. The superposed WIPT waveforms are optimized as a function of the channel state information so as to characterize the rate-energy region of the whole system. Analysis and numerical results illustrate the performance of the derived waveforms and WIPT architecture and highlight that nonlinearity radically changes the design of WIPT. We make key and refreshing observations. First, analysis (confirmed by circuit simulations) shows that modulated and unmodulated waveforms are not equally suitable for wireless power delivery, namely, modulation being beneficial in single-carrier transmissions but detrimental in multicarrier transmissions. Second, a multicarrier unmodulated waveform (superposed to a multicarrier modulated waveform) is useful to enlarge the rate-energy region of WIPT. Third, a combination of power splitting and time sharing is in general the best strategy. Fourth, a nonzero mean Gaussian input distribution outperforms the conventional capacity-Achieving zero-mean Gaussian input distribution in multicarrier transmissions. Fifth, the rectifier nonlinearity is beneficial to system performance and is essential to efficient WIPT design.},

Currently, the community is experiencing a paradigm shift in wireless network design, namely, unifying wireless transmission of information and power so as to make the best use of the RF spectrum and radiation as well as the network infrastructure for the dual purpose of communicating and energizing. In this paper, we review and discuss recent progress in laying the foundations of the envisioned dual purpose networks by establishing a signal theory and design for wireless information and power transmission (WIPT) and identifying the fundamental tradeoff between conveying information and power wirelessly. We start with an overview of WIPT challenges and technologies, namely, simultaneous WIPT (SWIPT), wirelessly powered communication networks (WPCNs), and wirelessly powered backscatter communication (WPBC). We then characterize energy harvesters and show how WIPT signal and system designs crucially revolve around the underlying energy harvester model. To that end, we highlight three different energy harvester models, namely, one linear model and two nonlinear models, and show how WIPT designs differ for each of them in single-user and multi-user deployments. Topics discussed include rate-energy region characterization, transmitter and receiver architectures, waveform design, modulation, beamforming and input distribution optimizations, resource allocation, and RF spectrum use. We discuss and check the validity of the different energy harvester models and the resulting signal theory and design based on circuit simulations, prototyping, and experimentation.

Recently, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has been considered as one of the revolutionary technologies to enable energy-efficient and smart wireless communications, which is a two-dimensional structure with a large number of passive elements. In this paper, we develop a new type of high-gain yet low-cost RIS that bears 256 elements. The proposed RIS combines the functions of phase shift and radiation together on an electromagnetic surface, where positive intrinsic-negative (PIN) diodes are used to realize 2-bit phase shifting for beamforming. This radical design forms the basis for the world's first wireless communication prototype using RIS having 256 two-bit elements. The prototype consists of modular hardware and flexible software that encompass the following: the hosts for parameter setting and data exchange, the universal software radio peripherals (USRPs) for baseband and radio frequency (RF) signal processing, as well as the RIS for signal transmission and reception. Our performance evaluation confirms the feasibility and efficiency of RISs in wireless communications. We show that, at 2.3 GHz, the proposed RIS can achieve a 21.7 dBi antenna gain. At the millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency, that is, 28.5 GHz, it attains a 19.1 dBi antenna gain.

For each scheme, the optimal reflection coefficient or the optimal primary transmit power are derived and closed-form expressions of outage probability are then developed for both primary and backscatter systems. Also, asymptotic outage behavior is characterized in the high transmit signal-To-noise ratio (SNR) regime. Our analysis shows that for the backscatter system, both parasitic and competitive schemes achieve the same outage probability which is irrelevant to the backscatter channels, whereas the commensal scheme can attain exactly the same asymptotic outage performance with the other two schemes at high transmit SNR. In addition, as the SNR threshold of the backscatter system approaches to zero, the three schemes can achieve the same outage performance for the backscatter system.

Generalized multi-user and low complexity single-user algorithms are demonstrated based on alternating optimization (AO) framework to maximize the weighted sum output direct current (DC), subject to the transmit power constraints and passive beamforming modulus constraints. The input signal waveform and IRS passive beamforming phase shifts are jointly designed as a function of users&#x2019; individual frequency-selective channel state information (CSI). The energy harvester nonlinearity is explored and two IRS deployment schemes, namely frequency selective IRS (FS-IRS) and frequency flat IRS (FF-IRS), are modeled and analyzed. This paper highlights the fact that IRS can provide an extra passive beamforming gain on output DC power over conventional WPT designs and significantly influence the waveform design by leveraging the benefit of passive beamforming, frequency diversity and energy harvester nonlinearity. Even though FF-IRS exhibits lower output DC than the ideal FS-IRS, it still achieves substantially increased DC power over conventional WPT designs. Performance evaluations confirm the significant benefits of a joint waveform and passive beamforming design accounting for the energy harvester nonlinearity to boost the performance of single-user and multi-user WPT systems.},

To avoid the need of the instantaneous information, including the specific codes and the instantaneous channel state information of the backscatter links, and to optimize the transmit power and the BD reflection coefficients, we derive the asymptotic BD signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) by employing the large-dimension random matrix theory. We formulate the joint optimization problem to maximize the minimum asymptotic SINR among BDs with guaranteeing the primary target rate. By investigating the property of the problem, the original problem is transformed and solved by the proposed iterative-based algorithm. Extensive simulations are executed to verify our theoretical analysis and demonstrate the outperformance of the proposed algorithm.},

Because of the multiplicative operation at the ambient backscatter device when reflecting the transmitter&#x2019;s signal, the achievable sum rate of the system is not known. Hence, we first derive the information-theoretic achievable rate region for a discrete memoryless channel and, subsequently, for Gaussian channels. We then propose a joint optimization framework for maximizing the system energy efficiency as the tradeoff and ratio between the overall sum rate and the power consumption, under user minimum rate constraints. For this, we propose a modification that simplifies the resulting non-convex optimization problems, which enables us to obtain the optimal reflection coefficient and power allocation policy analytically (up to a one line search). Numerical results demonstrate the negligible impact of the introduced modification on the optimality of our solution. Remarkably, our results show that the ambient backscatter-aided NOMA significantly outperforms OMA: the relative gain increases with the number of receivers, reaching up to 14&#x00D7; improvement over OMA. At last, we show the pertinence of our solution also under imperfect channel state information.},

The DP method has complexity O(q (N-M)2 ,M) , where N and M are the alphabet sizes of the DMC output and quantizer output, respectively. Then, starting from the quadrangle inequality, two techniques are applied to reduce the DP method's complexity. One technique makes use of the Shor-Moran-Aggarwal-Wilber-Klawe (SMAWK) algorithm and achieves complexity O(q (N-M) M). The other technique is much easier to be implemented and achieves complexity O(q (N2 - M2)). We further derive a sufficient condition under which the optimal SDQ is optimal among all quantizers and the two techniques are applicable. This generalizes the results in the literature for binary-input DMC. Next, we show that the cost function of α -mutual information ( α -MI)-maximizing quantizer belongs to the category of C. We further prove that under a weaker condition than the sufficient condition we derived, the aforementioned two techniques are applicable to the design of α -MI-maximizing quantizer.

Four additional references that give a brief treatment of the case of real-valued scalar functions which depend complex-valued vectors are [6, App. B], [7, App. 2.B], [8, Subsec. 2.3.10], and [9]. Reference [10] serves as an introduction to this area for complex-valued scalar functions with complex-valued argument vectors. Results on complex differentiation theory is given in [11], [12] for differentiation with respect to complex-valued scalars and vectors, however, the more general matrix case is not considered. In [13], the authors find derivatives of scalar functions with respect to complex-valued matrices, however, that paper could have been considerably simplified if the proposed theory was utilized. Examples of problems where the unknown matrix is a complex-valued matrix are wide ranging including precoding of MIMO systems [14], linear equalization design [15], array signal processing [16] to only cite a few. Some of the most relevant applications to signal and communication problems are presented here, with key results being highlighted and other illustrative examples are listed in tables. For an extended version, see [17]. The rest of this correspondence is organized as follows: In Section II, the complex differential is introduced, and based on this differential, the definition of the derivatives of a complex-valued matrix function with respect to the complex-valued matrix argument and its complex conjugate is given in Section III. The key procedure showing how the derivatives can be found from the differential of a function is also presented in Section III. Section IV contains the important results of equivalent conditions for finding stationary points and in which direction the function has the maximum rate of change. In Section V, several key results are placed in tables and some results are derived for various cases with high relevance for signal processing and communication problems. Section VI contains some conclusions. Some of the proofs are given in appendices. Notation: Scalar quantities (variables z or functions f) are denoted by lowercase symbols, vector quantities (variables z z z or functions f f f) are denoted by lowercase boldface symbols, and matrix quantities (vari-ables Z Z Z or functions F F F) are denoted by capital boldface symbols. The types of functions used throughout this correspondence are classified in Table I.

To characterize the non-coherent decoding performance, a practical upper bound of the average symbol error rate (SER) is derived. Subsequently, we jointly optimize the beamformer at the AP and the phase shifts at the IRS to maximize the average sum-rate of the primary system taking into account the maximum tolerable SER constraint for the SU.

Therefore, each PR needs to jointly decode the information from both the PT and its corresponding RIS. We are interested in maximizing the weighted sum-rate of both primary and IoT transmissions by jointly designing the active transmit beamforming at PT and the passive beamforming at each RIS under the maximum transmit power constraint at the PT and various constraints on the reflection coefficients (RCs), which include the ideal, continuous-phase and the discrete-phase cases. The formulated problem is non-convex, which cannot be solved directly. Thus, fractional programming (FP) method and alternating optimization (AO) technique are adopted to tackle the problem. In particular, three low-complexity algorithms are proposed to trade off between computational complexity and convergence rate. Compared to different benchmark schemes, simulation results demonstrate that with the aid of the RISs, the PRs can benefit from the enhanced primary transmission from the PT, and receive information from the associated RISs via IoT transmission.},

The primary transmitter communicates with the IR and at the same time assists the IRS in forwarding information to the IR. Based on the IRS's symbol period, we distinguish two scenarios, namely, commensal SR (CSR) and parasitic SR (PSR), where two different techniques for decoding the IRS signals at the IR are employed. We formulate bit error rate (BER) minimization problems for both scenarios by jointly optimizing the active beamformer at the base station and the phase shifts at the IRS, subject to a minimum primary rate requirement. Specifically, for the CSR scenario, a penalty-based algorithm is proposed to obtain a high-quality solution, where semi-closed-form solutions for the active beamformer and the IRS phase shifts are derived based on Lagrange duality and Majorization-Minimization methods, respectively. For the PSR scenario, we apply a bisection search-based method, successive convex approximation, and difference of convex programming to develop a computationally efficient algorithm, which converges to a locally optimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms and show that the proposed SR techniques are able to achieve a lower BER than benchmark schemes.},

Particularly, we propose three types of IRS beamforming configurations to strike a balance between the system performance and signaling overhead as well as implementation complexity. We first propose the fully dynamic IRS beamforming, where the IRS phase-shift vectors vary with each time slot for both DL wireless energy transfer (WET) and UL wireless information transmission (WIT). To further reduce signaling overhead and implementation complexity, we then study two special cases, namely, partially dynamic IRS beamforming and static IRS beamforming. For the former case, two different phase-shift vectors can be exploited for the DL WET and the UL WIT, respectively, whereas for the latter case, the same phase-shift vector needs to be applied for both DL and UL transmissions. We aim to maximize the system throughput by jointly optimizing the time allocation, HAP transmit power, and IRS phase shifts for the above three cases. Two efficient algorithms based on alternating optimization and penalty-based algorithms are respectively proposed for both perfect self-interference cancellation (SIC) case and imperfect SIC case by applying successive convex approximation and difference-of-convex optimization techniques. Simulation results demonstrate the benefits of IRS for enhancing the performance of FD-WPCN, and also show that the IRS-aided FD-WPCN is able to achieve significantly performance gain compared to its counterpart with half-duplex when the self-interference (SI) is properly suppressed.},

The objective of this paper is to minimize the total transmit power at the Radcom BS by jointly optimizing the active beamformers, including communication beamformers and radar beamformers, at the Radcom BS and the phase shifts at the IRS, subject to the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) required by communication users, the minimum SINR required by the radar, and the cross-correlation pattern design. In particular, we consider two cases, namely, case I and case II, based on the presence or absence of the radar cross-correlation design and the interference introduced by the IRS on the Radcom BS. For case I where the cross-correlation design and the interference are not considered, we prove that the dedicated radar signals are not needed, which significantly reduces implementation complexity and simplifies algorithm design. Then, a penalty-based algorithm is proposed to solve the resulting non-convex optimization problem. Whereas for case II considering the cross-correlation design and the interference, we unveil that the dedicated radar signals are needed in general to enhance the system performance. Since the resulting optimization problem is more challenging to solve as compared with the case I, the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) based alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is proposed. Particularly, instead of relying on the Gaussian randomization technique to obtain an approximate solution by reconstructing rank-one solution, the tightness is achieved by our proposed reconstruction strategy. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed algorithms and also show the superiority of the proposed scheme over various benchmark schemes.},

Is this fact true for a radio system, as well? The question has existed for decades. In this article, the equivalent circuits of antenna systems are reexamined. It is demonstrated that classical equivalent circuit models based on the Thvenin and Norton theorems are not suitable for a receiving antenna system since the antenna cannot be simply approximated by a voltage or current source. A constant power source is required but not readily available. Thus, two new general power source models are introduced and examined. It is found that they may be suitable for a transmitting antenna system but not accurate enough for a receiving antenna when the antenna loss is taken into account. A novel special constant power source model is therefore proposed and shown to accurately simulate the behavior of a receiving antenna. When the load impedance is the complex conjugate of the antenna impedance, maximum power is obtained, and the power transfer efficiency is simultaneously maximized (up to 100\{\%\} if the antenna system is lossless).},

	abstract  = {Electromagnetic field theory provides the physics of radio communications, while information theory approaches the problem from a purely mathematical point of view. While there is a law of conservation of energy in physics, there is no such law in information theory. Consequently, when, in information theory, reference is made (as it frequently is) to terms like energy, power, noise, or antennas, it is by no means guaranteed that their use is consistent with the physics of the communication system. Circuit theoretic multiport concepts can help in bridging the gap between the physics of electromagnetic fields and the mathematical world of information theory, so that important terms like energy or antenna are indeed used consistently through all layers of abstraction. In this paper, we develop circuit theoretic multiport models for radio communication systems. To demonstrate the utility of the circuit theoretic approach, an in-depth analysis is provided on the impact of impedance matching, antenna mutual coupling, and different sources of noise on the performance of the communication system. Interesting insights are developed about the role of impedance matching and the noise properties of the receive amplifiers, as well as the way array gain and channel capacity scale with the number of antennas in different circumstances. One particularly interesting result is that, with arrays of lossless antennas that receive isotropic background noise, efficient multistreaming can be achieved no matter how densely the antennas are packed. © 2006 IEEE.},

The unique channel characteristics arising from multiple reflections at the IRS render the optimization problem highly non-convex. Therefore, we jointly utilize the minorization-maximization algorithm and the semidefinite relaxation technique to present an approximate solution for the optimal IRS phase shift design. We also extend our analytical results to the monostatic BackCom system. Numerical results indicate that the introduction of the IRS brings about considerable reductions in transmit power, even with moderate IRS sizes, which can be translated to range increases over the non-IRS-assisted BackCom system.},

	abstract  = {As backscatter-based IoT applications get proliferated, how to exploit backscattered signals for efficient sensing becomes a significant issue. Backscatter-based sensing requires accurate estimation of a backscatter channel (phase and amplitude), which is distorted when multiple signals collide with each other. As a result, the state of the arts is limited to either parallel decoding of collided signal or channel estimation with clean signal. Motivated by the need of high sensing capacity, we in this article present Fireworks, the first approach for channel estimation of parallel backscattered signals. The insight of Fireworks is that although the channel is distorted due to collision, the movements of the ON-OFF Keying modulated signal still preserve the channel properties of the respective tags. By modeling the relationship between the channels and the signal's moving trajectory in the IQ domain, one can make accurate estimation of the channels directly from the collision. We address practical problems of Fireworks, such as the high computing complexity and the compatibility with the commercial MAC protocol, and implement Fireworks. The results show that Fireworks is able to estimate the channels of up to five tags in parallel. When applied to the tracking application, Fireworks achieves 2sim 4times improvement in the tracking accuracy, compared with the state-of-the-art approach.},

	abstract = {Simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) has emerged as a viable technique to energize and connect low-power autonomous devices and enable future Internet of Things (IoT). A major challenge of SWIPT is the energy consumption of the receiver of such low-power devices. An attractive low-power solution consists in an integrated information decoder (ID) and energy harvester (EH) architecture for SWIPT receiver (IntRx) where the received RF signal is first rectified before being used for information decoding. Such architecture eliminates the need for energy-consuming RF components such as local oscillators and mixers. This paper proposes a novel modulation and demodulation method for the IntRx SWIPT architecture based on pulse position modulation (PPM) where information is encoded in the position of the pulse. The new method transmits high amplitude pulses to increase the Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) of the transmit signal and exploits the EH's nonlinearity so as to boost the harvested DC power. Simultaneously, the information can be decoded from the rectifier signal by simply finding the position of the pulse in a certain symbol duration. We have analyzed both the information and the power transfer performance of the newly proposed PPM for IntRx SWIPT theoretically, numerically, and experimentally. To that end, we have established a SWIPT system testbed in an indoor environment by prototyping a base station to transfer information-power signal and the IntRx SWIPT receiver including ID and EH blocks. The performance evaluation of the PPM was carried out in various conditions, and the results have been compared and contrasted to conventional signals. Theoretical, numerical, and experimental results highlight the significant benefits of the proposed PPM scheme to enhance the power transfer performance and operate information decoding with low-power consumption.},

Under a given requirement on the rate outage probability for receivers, we aim to maximize the system utility (e.g., the weighted sum rate, weighted geometric mean rate, and the weighed harmonic mean rate) subject to the rate outage constraints and individual power constraints. The outage constraints, however, lead to a complicated, nonconvex structure for the considered beamforming design problem and render the optimization problem difficult to handle. Although this nonconvex optimization problem can be solved in an exhaustive search manner, this brute-force approach is only feasible when the number of transmitter-receiver pairs is small. For a system with a large number of transmitter-receiver pairs, computationally efficient alternatives are necessary. Hence, the focus of this paper is the design of such efficient approximation methods. In particular, by employing semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and first-order approximation techniques, we propose an efficient successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm that provides high-quality approximate beamforming solutions via solving a sequence of convex approximation problems. The solution thus obtained is further shown to be a stationary point for the SDR of the original outage constrained beamforming design problem. Furthermore, we propose a distributed SCA algorithm where each transmitter optimizes its own beamformer using local CDI and information obtained from limited message exchange with the other transmitters. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed SCA algorithm and its distributed counterpart indeed converge, and promising performance can be achieved for all the considered system utilities. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

Different from the recently introduced concept of intelligent omni-surface (or simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RIS), the multi-sector BD-RIS not only achieves a full-space coverage, but also has significant performance gains thanks to the highly directional beam of each sector. We derive the constraint of the multi-sector BD-RIS and the corresponding channel model taking into account the relationship between antenna beamwidth and gain.

Recently, a new technique, called symbiotic radio (SR), is proposed to exploit the benefits and address the drawbacks of cognitive radio (CR) and ambient backscattering communications (AmBC), leading to mutualism spectrum sharing and highly reliable backscattering communications. In particular, the secondary transmitter (STx) in SR transmits messages to the secondary receiver (SRx) over the RF signals originating from the primary transmitter (PTx) based on cognitive backscattering communications, thus the secondary system shares not only the radio spectrum, but also the power, and infrastructure with the primary system. In return, the secondary transmission provides beneficial multipath diversity to the primary system, therefore the two systems form mutualism spectrum sharing. More importantly, joint decoding is exploited at SRx to achieve highly reliable backscattering communications. In this article, to exploit the full potential of SR, we provide a systematic view for SR and address three fundamental tasks in SR: (1) enhancing the backscattering link via active load; (2) achieving highly reliable communications through joint decoding; and (3) capturing PTx's RF signals using reconfigurable intelligent surfaces.

Thus, backscatter communication has shown great potential for achieving low-power communication. The double-fading effect associated with the backscatter link, however, is a major limiting factor to achieve efficient backscatter communication. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), a recently developed technology, can be applied at the BD to enhance the backscatter link thanks to the fact that both RIS and backscatter communication share the same reflective principle. Such a design can also allow the backscatter communication system to capture the desired RF signal as a reflective carrier in a complex radio environment. In this article, a comprehensive overview of backscatter communication assisted by RIS is given. We first introduce the basics of backscatter communication, which covers the antenna scattering principle, backscatter modulation, and link budget calculation. Then, the details of RIS are discussed, which include antenna-based RIS and metamaterial-based RIS, followed by the discussion of the roles of RIS in backscatter communication.

In this paper we investigate the problem of precoder design for a low-resolution IRS-based transmitter to implement multiuser MISO/MIMO wireless communications. Particularly, the IRS modulates information symbols by varying the phases of its reflecting elements and transmits them to K single-antenna or multi-antenna users. We first aim to design the symbol-level precoder for IRS to realize the modulation and minimize the maximum symbol-error-rate (SER) of single-antenna receivers. In order to tackle this NP-hard problem, we first relax the low-resolution phase-shift constraint and solve this problem by Riemannian conjugate gradient (RCG) algorithm. Then, the low-resolution symbol-level precoding vector is obtained by direct quantization. Considering the large quantization error for 1-bit resolution case, the branch-and-bound method is utilized to solve the 1-bit resolution symbol-level precoding vector. For multi-antenna receivers, we propose to iteratively design the symbol-level precoder and combiner by decomposing the original large-scale optimization problem into several sub-problems.

We aim to jointly design the dual-functional transmit waveform and the passive beamforming of RIS to maximize the radar output signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) achieved by space-time adaptive processing (STAP), while satisfying the communication quality-of-service (QoS) requirement under one of three metrics, the constant-modulus constraint on the transmit waveform, and the unit-modulus constraint of RIS reflecting coefficients. An efficient algorithm framework based on the alternative direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and majorization-minimization (MM) methods is developed to solve the complicated non-convex optimization problem. Simulation results verify the advancement of the proposed RIS-assisted DRFC scheme and the effectiveness of the developed ADMM-MM-based joint transmit waveform and passive beamforming design algorithm.},

	abstract = {Ambient backscatter communication (AmBC) leverages the existing ambient radio frequency (RF) environment to implement communication with battery-free devices. One critical challenge of AmBC systems is signal recovery because the transmitted information bits are embedded in the ambient RF signals and these are unknown and uncontrollable. To address this problem, most existing approaches use averaging-based energy detectors and consequently the data rate is low and there is an error floor. Here we propose a new detection strategy based on the ratio between signals received from a multiple-antenna Reader. The advantage of using the ratio is that ambient RF signals are removed directly from the embedded signals without averaging and hence it can increase data rates and avoid the error floor. Different from original ratio detectors that use the magnitude ratio of the signals between two Reader antennas, in our proposed approach, we utilize the complex ratio so that phase information is preserved and propose an accurate linear channel model approximation. This allows the application of existing linear detection techniques from which we can obtain a minimum distance detector and closed-form expressions for bit error rate (BER). In addition, averaging, coding and interleaving can also be included to further enhance the BER. The results are also general, allowing any number of Reader antennas to be utilized in the approach. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach performs better than approaches based on energy detection and original ratio detectors.},

	abstract = {In this article, a symbiotic radio (SR) system is proposed to support passive Internet of Things (IoT), in which a backscatter device (BD), also called IoT device, is parasitic in a primary transmission. The primary transmitter (PT) is designed to assist both the primary and BD transmissions, and the primary receiver (PR) is used to decode the information from the PT as well as the BD. The symbol period for BD transmission is assumed to be either equal to or much greater than that of the primary one, resulting in parasitic SR (PSR) or commensal SR (CSR) setup. We consider a basic SR system which consists of three nodes: 1) a multiantenna PT; 2) a single-antenna BD; and 3) a single-antenna PR. We first derive the achievable rates for the primary and BD transmissions for each setup. Then, we formulate two transmit beamforming optimization problems, i.e., the weighted sum-rate maximization (WSRM) problem and the transmit power minimization (TPM) problem, and solve these nonconvex problems by applying the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique. In addition, a novel transmit beamforming structure is proposed to reduce the computational complexity of the solutions. The simulation results show that for CSR setup, the proposed solution enables the opportunistic transmission for the BD via energy-efficient passive backscattering without any loss in spectral efficiency, by properly exploiting the additional signal path from the BD.},

To address the need for green and sustainable future cellular networks, the concept of reconfiguring wireless propagation environments using Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRS)s has emerged. An IRS comprises of a large number of low-cost passive antennas that can smartly reflect the impinging electromagnetic waves for performance enhancement. This paper looks at the evolution of the reflective radio concept towards IRSs, outlines the IRS-assisted multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) communication model and discusses how it differentiates from the conventional multi-antenna communication models. We propose a minimum mean squared error (MMSE) based channel estimation protocol for the design and analysis of IRS-assisted systems. Performance evaluation results at 2.5 GHz operating frequency are provided to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed system.},

RISs have been traditionally realized through single connected architectures, mathematically characterized by a diagonal scattering matrix. Recently, beyond diagonal RISs (BD-RISs) have been proposed as a novel branch of RISs whose scattering matrix is not limited to be diagonal, which creates new benefits and opportunities for RISs. Efficient BD-RIS architectures have been realized based on group and fully connected reconfigurable impedance networks. However, a closed-form solution for the global optimal scattering matrix of these architectures is not yet available. In this paper, we provide such a closed-form solution proving that the theoretical performance upper bounds can be exactly achieved for any channel realization. We first consider the received signal power maximization in single-user single-input single-output (SISO) systems aided by a BD-RIS working in reflective or transmissive mode. Then, we extend our solution to single-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems. We show that our algorithm is less complex than the iterative optimization algorithms employed in the previous literature. The complexity of our algorithm grows linearly (resp. cubically) with the number of RIS elements in the case of group (resp. fully) connected architectures.},

BD-RIS has a scattering matrix that is not restricted to being diagonal and thus brings a performance improvement over conventional RIS. While different BD-RIS architectures have been proposed, it still remains an open problem to develop a systematic approach to design BD-RIS architectures achieving the optimal trade-off between performance and circuit complexity. In this work, we propose novel modeling, architecture design, and optimization for BD-RIS based on graph theory. This graph theoretical modeling allows us to develop two new efficient BD-RIS architectures, denoted as tree-connected and forest-connected RIS. Tree-connected RIS, whose corresponding graph is a tree, is proven to be the least complex BD-RIS architecture able to achieve the performance upper bound in multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems. Besides, forest-connected RIS allows us to strike a balance between performance and complexity, further decreasing the complexity over tree-connected RIS. To optimize tree-connected RIS, we derive a closed-form global optimal solution, while forest-connected RIS is optimized through a low-complexity iterative algorithm. Numerical results confirm that tree-connected (resp. forest-connected) RIS achieves the same performance as fully-connected (resp. group-connected) RIS, while reducing the complexity by up to 16.4 times.},

It was shown that transmit diversity is capable of narrowing the gap between the capacity of the Rayleigh-fading channel and that of the additive white Gaussian noise channel. However, because this gap becomes narrower when the receiver diversity order is increased, for higher order receiver diversity, the performance advantage of transmit diversity diminishes. A MIMO system having full multiplexing gain has a higher achievable throughput than the corresponding MIMO system designed for full diversity gain, although this is attained at the cost of a higher complexity and a higher signal-to-noise ratio. The tradeoffs between diversity gain, multiplexing gain, complexity, and bandwidth are studied. © 2006 IEEE.},

Our goal is to maximize the spectral efficiency of this system by jointly optimizing the (active) precoding at the source and the (passive) phase shifters (PSs) at the IRS. However, this turns out to be an intractable mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem. To circumvent the intractability, we propose a new sum-path-gain maximization (SPGM) criterion to obtain a high-quality and efficient suboptimal solution to this problem. Specifically, the PSs are first designed based on a simplified optimization problem, which aims to maximize the sum-gains of the spatial paths between the source and the destination. Then, a low-complexity alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm is utilized to solve this simplified problem. Finally, with the above obtained PSs, the source precoding is derived by performing the singular value decomposition (SVD) on the effective channel between the source and the destination.

	abstract      = {Recently, joint wireless information and energy transfer (JWIET) methods have been proposed to relieve the battery limitation of wireless devices. However, the JWIET in a general K-user MIMO interference channel (IFC) has been unexplored so far. In this paper, we investigate for the first time the JWIET in K-user MIMO IFC, in which receivers either decode the incoming information data (information decoding, ID) or harvest the RF energy (energy harvesting, EH). In the K-user IFC, we consider three different scenarios according to the receiver mode: i) multiple EH receivers and a single ID receiver, ii) multiple IDs and a single EH, and iii) multiple IDs and multiple EHs. For all scenarios, we have found a common necessary condition of the optimal transmission strategy and, accordingly, developed the transmission strategy that satisfies the common necessary condition, in which all the transmitters transferring energy exploit a rank-one energy beamforming. Furthermore, we have also proposed an iterative algorithm to optimize the covariance matrices of the transmitters that transfer information and the powers of the energy beamforming transmitters simultaneously, and identified the corresponding achievable rate-energy tradeoff region. Finally, we have shown that by selecting EH receivers according to their signal-to-leakage-and-harvested energy-ratio (SLER), we can improve the achievable rate-energy region further.},

Different from existing noncoherent schemes, we here design the semi-coherent detection, where channel-related parameters can be obtained from unknown data symbols and a few pilot symbols. In order to obtain a benchmark for overall detection, we first derive a maximum likelihood detector assuming a complex Gaussian ambient source, and the closed-form bit error rate (BER) is computed. To release the dependence on prior knowledge of the ambient source, we next derive a type of robust design, called an energy detector, with the ambient signal being either complex Gaussian or phase shift keying (PSK). The closed-form detection thresholds, analytical BERs, and outage probability are provided correspondingly. Interestingly, the complex Gaussian source would cause an error floor, while the PSK source does not, which brings nontrivial indication of constellation design as opposed to popular Gaussian-embedded literatures. We also propose an effective approach to estimate detection-required parameters rather than channels themselves. Numerical simulations are finally presented to verify theoretical results.},

Existing AB systems adopt two-state amplitude shift keying or phase shift keying (PSK), where data are transmitted at the rate of one bit per symbol period. To increase the data rate, we investigate the high-order modulation where M -PSK is employed for backscattering. We derive the optimal multilevel energy detector and compute the closed-form symbol error rate.

The hardware prototype can achieve the date rate of 20 kb/s. Besides, higher date rate is achievable for 98.7% of the time compared with binary AB communications, and the mean number of distinguishable symbols is 3.66.},

Instead of assuming Gaussian input distribution, the proposed study matches the practical ambient backscatter scenarios, where the input of the tag can only be binary. We derive the closed-form capacity expression as well as the capacity-achieving input distribution for the BIBO channel. To show the influence of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) on the capacity, a closed-form tight ceiling is also derived when SNR turns relatively large. For BISO and BIEO channel, we obtain the closed-form mutual information, while the semi-closed-form capacity value can be obtained via one dimensional searching. Simulations are provided to corroborate the theoretical studies. Interestingly, the simulations show that: (i) the detection threshold maximizing the capacity of BIBO channel is the same as the one from the maximum likelihood signal detection; (ii) the maximal of the mutual information of all channels is achieved almost by a uniform input distribution; and (iii) the mutual information of the BIEO channel is larger than that of the BIBO channel, but is smaller than that of the BISO channel.},

In addition, the scaling law of the received signal power of an IRS aided system with reconfigurable impedance networks is also derived. Compared with the single connected reconfigurable impedance network, our group and fully connected reconfigurable impedance network can increase the received signal power by up to 62%, or maintain the same received signal power with a number of IRS elements reduced by up to 21%. We also investigate the proposed architecture in deployments with distance-dependent pathloss and Rician fading channel, and show that the proposed group and fully connected reconfigurable impedance networks outperform the single connected case by up to 34% and 48%, respectively.},

However, the weak RF energy harvested and the short BC distance have become the two critical obstacles in the real-world implementation of this potential technology. In this paper, we propose a high-sensitivity RF energy harvesting (RFEH) and long-distance BC method, and for the first time, we demonstrate the RF-powered self-sustainable long-distance BC device named RFEH LoRa. In order to improve RFEH sensitivity, an ultra-low power (ULP) consumption voltage monitoring and startup control circuit topology is designed to reduce the power consumption to 245 nanowatt (nW) during the accumulation of RF energy. While in order to increase the BC distance, a direct digital frequency synthesis (DDS) technology is used to generate a linear frequency modulation (LFM) square wave sequence conforming to the LoRa specifications based on the ULP microcontroller unit (MCU), and the square wave is used to drive an RF switch to achieve long-distance BC of hundreds of meters. Test results show that the instantaneous BC current is as low as 130 microampere (lA), and the standby current is only 52 nanoampere (nA). RFEH LoRa is implemented with commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components. It can self-startup by harvesting RF energy as low as.22.5 dBm, and send its sensing data to the receiver of 381 meters away.},

	abstract  = {Passive and semipassive UHF RF identification (RFID) systems have traditionally been designed using scalar-valued differential radar cross section (DRCS) methods to model the backscattered signal from the tag. This paper argues that scalar-valued DRCS analysis is unnecessarily limiting because of the inherent coherence of the backscatter link and the complex-valued nature of load-dependent antenna-mode scattering from an RFID tag. Considering modulated backscatter in terms of complex-valued scattered fields opens the possibility of quadrature modulation of the backscatter channel. When compared with binary amplitude shift keying (ASK) or phase shift keying (PSK) based RFID systems, which transmit 1 bit of data per symbol period, and thus 1 bit per on-chip clock oscillator period, tags employing vector backscatter modulation can transmit more than 1 bit per symbol period. This increases the data rate for a given on-chip symbol clock rate leading to reduced on-chip power consumption and extended read range. Alternatively, tags employing an -ary modulator can achieve higher data throughput at essentially the same dc power consumption as a tag employing binary ASK or PSK. In contrast to the binary ASK or PSK backscatter modulation employed by passive and semipassive UHF RFID tags, such as tags compliant with the widely used ISO18000-6c standard, this paper explores a novel CMOS-compatible method for generating -ary quadrature amplitude modulated (QAM) backscatter modulation. A new method is presented for designing an inductorless -ary QAM backscatter modulator using only an array of switched resistances and capacitances. Device-level simulation and measurements of a four-state phase shift keying (4-PSK)/four-state quadrature amplitude modulated (4-QAM) modulator are provided for a semipassive (battery-assisted) tag operating in the 850-950-MHz band. This first prototype modulator transmits 4-PSK/4-QAM at a symbol rate of 200 kHz and a bit rate of 400 kb/s at a static power dissipation of only 115 nW. ©2012 IEEE.},

The optimization problem of maximizing rate-power (RP) region is studied. Assuming that the channel state information (CSI) is available at both the receiver and the transmitter, and constraining to the non-zero mean Gaussian input distributions, an optimization algorithm for power allocation among different subchannels is studied.

Results obtained from the numerical optimization demonstrate the superiority of the non-zero mean Gaussian inputs (with asymmetric power allocation in each complex subchannel) in yielding a larger RP region compared to their zero mean and non-zero mean (with symmetric power allocation in each complex subchannel) counterparts. The results motivate the design of new modulation for SWIPT and contrast with the SWIPT design under linear energy harvesting, for which the circularly symmetric Gaussian inputs with water-filling power allocation are optimal.},

The output delivered power constraint is modelled as the average of linear combination of even moments of the channel input being larger than a threshold. It is shown that the capacity of an AWGN channel under transmit average power and receiver delivered power constraints is the same as the capacity of an AWGN channel under an average power constraint. However, depending on the two constraints, the capacity can be either achieved by a Gaussian distribution or arbitrarily approached by using time-sharing between a Gaussian distribution and On-Off Keying. As an application, a simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) problem is studied, where an experimentally-validated nonlinear model of the harvester is used. It is shown that the delivered power depends on higher order moments of the channel input. Two inner bounds, one based on complex Gaussian inputs and the other based on further restricting the delivered power are obtained for the Rate-Power (RP) region. For Gaussian inputs, the optimal inputs are zero mean and a tradeoff between transmitted information and delivered power is recognized by considering asymmetric power allocations between inphase and quadrature subchannels. Through numerical algorithms, it is observed that input distributions (obtained by restricting the delivered power) attain larger RP region compared to Gaussian input counterparts.},

This paper provides a novel learning-based approach towards such wireless network design. To that end, a parametric model of a practical energy harvester, accounting for various sources of nonlinearities, is proposed using a nonlinear regression algorithm applied over collected real data. Relying on the proposed model, the learning problem of modulation design for Simultaneous Wireless Information-Power Transmission (SWIPT) over a point-to-point link is studied. Joint optimization of the transmitter and the receiver is implemented using Neural Network (NN)-based autoencoders. The results reveal that by increasing the receiver power demand, the baseband transmit modulation constellation converges to an On-Off keying signalling. Utilizing the observations obtained via learning, an algorithmic SWIPT modulation design is proposed. It is observed via numerical results that the performance loss of the proposed modulations are negligible compared to the ones obtained from learning. Extension of the studied problem to learning modulation design for multi-user SWIPT scenarios and coded modulation design for point-to-point SWIPT are considered. The major conclusion of this work is to utilize learning-based results to design non learning-based algorithms, which perform as well. In particular, inspired by the results obtained via learning, an algorithmic approach for coded modulation design is proposed, which performs very close to its learning counterparts, and is significantly superior due to its high real-time adaptability to new system design parameters.},

All proposed techniques are based on simple, but careful, switching frequency control at the tag, allowing for the easy frequency-domain multiple access. First, a digital modulation scheme is offered, namely pseudo-frequency shift keying, assuming illumination from constant envelope-modulated signals and a fully coherent detector is derived along with closed-form probability of error. A second digital modulation scheme is also offered, based on a frequency-shifted form of binary phase shift keying (S-BPSK), relaxing the constant-envelope requirement for the illuminator and an illumination-agnostic detector is derived. Based on S-BPSK, short packet error correction coding is utilized for ambient backscatter communication, for the first time in the literature. It is shown that the proposed coded scheme under modulated ambient signal illumination & wireless channel variation, offers tremendous performance gains, i.e., modulation of the ambient signal is helpful. Finally, a third, purely analog, modulation scheme is analyzed, based on FM remodulation principles. A low-cost tag is implemented, demonstrating tag-toreceiver ranges up to 26 meters outdoors, power consumption of 24 μWatts in continuous operation, able to be interrogated by any conventional frequency modulation (FM) receiver.

Specifically, an IRS consists of a large number of low-cost passive elements each reflecting the incident signal with a certain phase shift to collaboratively achieve beamforming and suppress interference at one or more designated receivers. In this paper, we study an IRS-enhanced point-to-point multiple-input single-output (MISO) wireless system where one IRS is deployed to assist in the communication from a multi-antenna access point (AP) to a single-antenna user. As a result, the user simultaneously receives the signal sent directly from the AP as well as that reflected by the IRS. We aim to maximize the total received signal power at the user by jointly optimizing the (active) transmit beamforming at the AP and (passive) reflect beamforming by the phase shifters at the IRS. We first propose a centralized algorithm based on the technique of semidefinite relaxation (SDR) by assuming the global channel state information (CSI) available at the IRS. Since the centralized implementation requires excessive channel estimation and signal exchange overheads, we further propose a low-complexity distributed algorithm where the AP and IRS independently adjust the transmit beamforming and the phase shifts in an alternating manner until the convergence is reached. Simulation results show that significant performance gains can be achieved by the proposed algorithms as compared to benchmark schemes. Moreover, it is verified that the IRS is able to drastically enhance the link quality and/or coverage over the conventional setup without the IRS.},

	abstract      = {Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a new and revolutionizing technology for achieving spectrum and energy efficient wireless networks. By leveraging massive low-cost passive elements that are able to reflect radio-frequency (RF) signals with adjustable phase shifts, IRS can achieve high passive beamforming gains, which are particularly appealing for improving the efficiency of RF-based wireless power transfer. Motivated by the above, we study in this paper an IRS-assisted simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) system. Specifically, a set of IRSs are deployed to assist in the information/power transfer from a multi-antenna access point (AP) to multiple single-antenna information users (IUs) and energy users (EUs), respectively. We aim to minimize the transmit power at the AP via jointly optimizing its transmit precoders and the reflect phase shifts at all IRSs, subject to the quality-of-service (QoS) constraints at all users, namely, the individual signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints at IUs and the energy harvesting constraints at EUs. However, this optimization problem is non-convex with intricately coupled variables, for which the existing alternating optimization approach is shown to be inefficient as the number of QoS constraints increases. To tackle this challenge, we first apply proper transformations on the QoS constraints and then propose an efficient iterative algorithm by applying the penalty-based optimization method. Moreover, by exploiting the short-range coverage of IRS, we further propose a more computationally efficient algorithm by optimizing the phase shifts at all IRSs in parallel. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of employing multiple IRSs for enhancing the performance of SWIPT systems as well as the significant performance gains achieved by our proposed algorithms over benchmark schemes. The impact of IRS on the transmitter/receiver design for SWIPT is also unveiled.},

Prior works on IRS mainly consider continuous phase shifts at reflecting elements, which are practically difficult to implement due to the hardware limitation. In contrast, we study in this paper an IRS-Aided wireless network, where an IRS with only a finite number of phase shifts at each element is deployed to assist in the communication from a multi-Antenna access point (AP) to multiple single-Antenna users. We aim to minimize the transmit power at the AP by jointly optimizing the continuous transmit precoding at the AP and the discrete reflect phase shifts at the IRS, subject to a given set of minimum signal-To-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints at the user receivers. The considered problem is shown to be a mixed-integer non-linear program (MINLP) and thus is difficult to solve in general. To tackle this problem, we first study the single-user case with one user assisted by the IRS and propose both optimal and suboptimal algorithms for solving it. Besides, we analytically show that as compared to the ideal case with continuous phase shifts, the IRS with discrete phase shifts achieves the same squared power gain in terms of asymptotically large number of reflecting elements, while a constant proportional power loss is incurred that depends only on the number of phase-shift levels. The proposed designs for the single-user case are also extended to the general setup with multiple users among which some are aided by the IRS. Simulation results verify our performance analysis as well as the effectiveness of our proposed designs as compared to various benchmark schemes.},

We investigate the beamforming design optimization problem which maximizes the sum capacity of primary and secondary transmissions under the capacity constraint of secondary transmission. In the MIMO SR backscatter system, each antenna of the SR BD reflects its received ambient radio frequency signals from all the transmitting antennas of the transmitter, which causes that the globally optimal solution is difficult to obtain. Here, we derive an algorithm to obtain the capacity upper bound. Furthermore, considering both primary and secondary transmissions, we propose an exact penalty method based locally optimal solution. Simulation results display that the proposed exact penalty method based locally optimal solution achieves the sum capacity which is close to the upper bound.},

Specifically, the IRS phase-shift vectors across time and resource allocation are jointly optimized to enhance the efficiencies of both downlink wireless power transfer (DL WPT) and uplink wireless information transmission (UL WIT) between a hybrid access point (HAP) and multiple wirelessly powered devices. To this end, we first study three special cases of the dynamic IRS beamforming,namely user-adaptive IRS beamforming, UL-adaptive IRS beamforming, and static IRS beamforming,by characterizing their optimal performance relationships and proposing corresponding algorithms. Interestingly, it is rigorously proved that the latter two cases achieve the same throughput, thus helping halve the number of IRS phase shifts to be optimized and signalling overhead practically required for UL-adaptive IRS beamforming. Then, we propose a general optimization framework for dynamic IRS beamforming, which is applicable for any given number of IRS phase-shift vectors available. Despite of the non-convexity of the general problem with highly coupled optimization variables, we propose two algorithms to solve it and particularly, the low-complexity algorithm exploits the intrinsic structure of the optimal solution as well as the solutions to the cases with user-adaptive and static IRS beamforming. Simulation results validate our theoretical findings, illustrate the practical significance of IRS with dynamic beamforming for spectral and energy efficient WPCNs, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed designs over various benchmark schemes.},

In return, the primary communication link can be enhanced by the additional multipaths created by the BD. This is known as the mutualism relationship of symbiotic radio. However, as the backscattering link is much weaker than the direct link due to double attenuations, the improvement of the primary link brought by one single BD is extremely limited. To address this issue and enable full mutualism of symbiotic radio, in this paper, we study symbiotic radio with massive number of BDs. For symbiotic radio multiple access channel (MAC) with successive interference cancellation (SIC), we first derive the achievable rate of both the primary and secondary communications, based on which a receive beamforming optimization problem is formulated and solved. Furthermore, considering the asymptotic regime of massive number of BDs, closed-form expressions are derived for the primary and the secondary communication rates, both of which are shown to be increasing functions of the number of BDs. This thus demonstrates that the mutualism relationship of symbiotic radio can be fully exploited with massive BD access.},

To this end, we adopt a physics-based IRS model that, unlike the conventional IRS model, takes into account the impact of the incident and reflection angles of the impinging electromagnetic wave on the reflected signal. To facilitate efficient resource allocation design for large IRSs, we employ a scalable optimization framework, where the IRS is partitioned into several tiles and the phase shift elements of each tile are jointly designed to realize different transmission modes. Then, the beamforming vectors at the base station (BS) and the transmission mode selection of the tiles of the IRS are jointly optimized for minimization of the BS transmit power taking into account the quality-of-service requirements of both non-linear energy harvesting receivers and information decoding receivers. For handling the resulting non-convex optimization problem, we apply a penalty-based method, successive convex approximation, and semidefinite relaxation to develop a computationally efficient algorithm which asymptotically converges to a locally optimal solution of the considered problem. Our simulation results show that the proposed scheme enables considerable power savings compared to two baseline schemes. Moreover, our results also illustrate that the advocated physics-based model and scalable optimization framework for large IRSs allows us to strike a balance between system performance and computational complexity, which is vital for realizing large IRS-assisted communication systems.},

The acquisition of the forward-channel (i.e., ET-to-ER) state information (F-CSI) at the ET (or RFID reader) is challenging, since the ERs (or RFID tags) are typically too energy-and-hardware-constrained to estimate or feedback the F-CSI. The ET leverages its observed backscatter signals to estimate the backscatter-channel (i.e., ET-to-ER-to-ET) state information (BS-CSI) directly. We first analyze the harvested energy obtained using the estimated BS-CSI. Furthermore, we optimize the resource allocation to maximize the total utility of harvested energy. For WET to single ER, we obtain the optimal channel-training energy in a semiclosed form. For WET to multiple ERs, we optimize the channel-training energy and the energy allocation weights for different energy beams. For the straightforward weighted-sum-energy (WSE) maximization, the optimal WET scheme is shown to use only one energy beam, which leads to unfairness among ERs and motivates us to consider the complicated proportional-fair-energy (PFE) maximization. For PFE maximization, we show that it is a biconvex problem, and propose a block-coordinate-descent-based algorithm to find the close-to-optimal solution. Numerical results show that with the optimized solutions, the harvested energy suffers slight reduction of less than 10\{\%\}, compared to that obtained using the perfect F-CSI.},

In this paper, we propose a cooperative AmBC (CABC) system in which the reader recovers information not only from the A-BD, but also from the RF source. We first establish the system model for the CABC system from spread spectrum and spectrum sharing perspectives. Then, for flat fading channels, we derive the optimal maximumlikelihood (ML) detector, suboptimal linear detectors as well as successive interference-cancellation (SIC) based detectors. For frequency-selective fading channels, the system model for the CABC system over ambient orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) carriers is proposed, upon which a low-complexity optimal ML detector is derived. For both kinds of channels, the bit-error-rate (BER) expressions for the proposed detectors are derived in closed forms. Finally, extensive numerical results have shown that, when the A-BD signal and the RF-source signal have equal symbol period, the proposed SIC-based detectors can achieve near-ML detection performance for typical application scenarios, and when the A-BD symbol period is longer than the RF-source symbol period, the existence of backscattered signal in the CABC system can enhance the ML detection performance of the RFsource signal, thanks to the beneficial effect of the backscatter link when the A-BD transmits at a lower rate than the RF source.},

To tackle this difficulty, we propose a novel dynamic passive beamforming scheme where the IRS reflection coefficients are dynamically adjusted over different time slots within each channel coherence block to create artificial time-varying channels and select only a subset of the users to be simultaneously served in each time slot, thus achieving a higher passive beamforming gain. Although the formulated optimization problem is non-convex, we propose an efficient algorithm to obtain a suboptimal solution to it. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme significantly improves the system common rate over the setup without IRS and that with random IRS reflection coefficients. Moreover, our proposed dynamic passive beamforming outperforms the fixed passive beamforming which employs a common set of reflection coefficients in each channel coherence block, by more flexibly balancing between passive beamforming and multiuser diversity gains.},

To address the low efficiencies of far-field power transfer, a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is adopted to enhance the energy harvesting (EH) performance, which can construct a favorable wireless propagation environment. In this paper, we consider an RIS-assisted SWIPT system with wireless transfer from the access point (AP) to multiple-antenna receivers, which include information receivers (IRs) and energy receivers (ERs). First, we formulate the problem of maximizing the minimum rates of the IRs as a nonconvex constrained optimization problem. For ideal and nonideal channels, we propose two different solutions. Second, we simplify the objective function and decompose the problem into several subproblems by using sorting and iterative optimization algorithms. Moreover, under optimal boundary and Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, we successfully solve this problem. The simulation results illustrate a promising approach for wireless communication by comparing ideal RIS and unsatisfactory situations with no RIS cases under various conditions.},

A practical transmission protocol is proposed to execute channel estimation and passive beamforming successively. To minimize the mean square error (MSE) of channel estimation, we first formulate an optimization problem for designing the IRS reflection pattern in the training phase under the constraints of unit-modulus, discrete phase, and full rank. This problem, however, is NP-hard and thus difficult to solve in general. As such, we propose a low-complexity yet efficient method to solve it sub-optimally, by constructing a near-orthogonal reflection pattern based on either discrete Fourier transform (DFT)-matrix quantization or Hadamard-matrix truncation. Based on the estimated channel, we then formulate an optimization problem to maximize the achievable rate by designing the discrete-phase passive beamforming at the IRS with the training overhead and channel estimation error taken into account. To reduce the computational complexity of exhaustive search, we further propose a low-complexity successive refinement algorithm with a properly-designed initialization to obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution. Numerical results are presented to show the significant rate improvement of our proposed IRS training reflection pattern and passive beamforming designs as compared to other benchmark schemes.},

In practice, WPT is implementable by various technologies such as inductive coupling, magnetic resonate coupling, and electromagnetic (EM) radiation, for short-/mid-/long- range applications, respectively. In this paper, we consider the EM or radio signal enabled WPT in particular. Since radio signals can carry energy as well as information at the same time, a unified study on simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) is pursued. Specifically, this paper studies a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless broadcast system consisting of three nodes, where one receiver harvests energy and another receiver decodes information separately from the signals sent by a common transmitter, and all the transmitter and receivers may be equipped with multiple antennas. Two scenarios are examined, in which the information receiver and energy receiver are separated and see different MIMO channels from the transmitter, or co-located and see the identical MIMO channel from the transmitter. For the case of separated receivers, we derive the optimal transmission strategy to achieve different tradeoffs for maximal information rate versus energy transfer, which are characterized by the boundary of a so-called rate-energy (R-E) region. For the case of co-located receivers, we show an outer bound for the achievable R-E region due to the potential limitation that practical energy harvesting receivers are not yet able to decode information directly. Under this constraint, we investigate two practical designs for the co-located receiver case, namely time switching and power splitting, and characterize their achievable R-E regions in comparison to the outer bound. {\textcopyright} 2002-2012 IEEE.},

First, we consider narrowband transmission under frequency-flat fading channels, and develop an efficient alternating optimization algorithm to find a locally optimal solution by iteratively optimizing the transmit covariance matrix or one of the reflection coefficients with the others being fixed. Next, we consider capacity maximization for broadband transmission in a general MIMO orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system under frequency-selective fading channels, where transmit covariance matrices can be optimized for different subcarriers while only one common set of IRS reflection coefficients can be designed to cater to all subcarriers. To tackle this more challenging problem, we propose a new alternating optimization algorithm based on convex relaxation to find a high-quality suboptimal solution. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithms achieve substantially increased capacity compared to traditional MIMO channels without the IRS, and also outperform various benchmark schemes.

The above modulation scheme innately enables a new multiplicative multiple access channel (M-MAC), where the primary and secondary signals are superposed in a multiplicative and additive manner. To pursue the fundamental performance limits of the M-MAC, we focus on the characterization of the capacity region of such systems. Due to the passive nature of RISs, the transmitted signal of the RIS should satisfy the peak power constraint. Under this constraint at the RIS as well as the average power constraint at the primary transmitter (PTx), we analyze the capacity-achieving distributions of the transmitted signals and characterize the capacity region of the M-MAC. Then, theoretical analysis is performed to reveal insights into the RIS-assisted SR. It is observed that: 1) the capacity region of the M-MAC is strictly convex and larger than that of the conventional TDMA scheme; 2) the secondary transmission can achieve the maximum rate when the PTx transmits the constant envelope signals; 3) and the sum rate can achieve the maximum when the PTx transmits Gaussian signals and the RIS transmits the constant envelope signals. Finally, extensive numerical results are provided to evaluate the performance of the RIS-assisted SR and verify the accuracy of our theoretical analysis.},

RIScatter is a batteryless cognitive radio that recycles ambient signal in an adaptive and customizable manner, where dispersed or co-located scatter nodes partially modulate their information and partially engineer the wireless channel. The key is to render the probability distribution of reflection states as a joint function of the information source, Channel State Information (CSI), and relative priority of coexisting links. This enables RIScatter to softly bridge BackCom and RIS; reduce to either in special cases; or evolve in a mixed form for heterogeneous traffic control and universal hardware design. We also propose a low-complexity Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC)-free receiver that exploits the properties of RIScatter. For a single-user multi-node network, we characterize the achievable primary-(total-)backscatter rate region by optimizing the input distribution at scatter nodes, the active beamforming at the Access Point (AP), and the energy decision regions at the user.

Yet practical receiver designs impose technical constraints on its hardware realization, as practical circuits for harvesting energy from radio signals are not yet able to decode the carried information directly. To make theoretical progress, we propose a general receiver operation, namely, dynamic power splitting (DPS), which splits the received signal with adjustable power ratio for energy harvesting and information decoding, separately. Three special cases of DPS, namely, time switching (TS), static power splitting (SPS) and on-off power splitting (OPS) are investigated. The TS and SPS schemes can be treated as special cases of OPS. Moreover, we propose two types of practical receiver architectures, namely, separated versus integrated information and energy receivers. The integrated receiver integrates the front-end components of the separated receiver, thus achieving a smaller form factor. The rate-energy tradeoff for the two architectures are characterized by a so-called rate-energy (R-E) region. The optimal transmission strategy is derived to achieve different rate-energy tradeoffs. With receiver circuit power consumption taken into account, it is shown that the OPS scheme is optimal for both receivers. For the ideal case when the receiver circuit does not consume power, the SPS scheme is optimal for both receivers. In addition, we study the performance for the two types of receivers under a realistic system setup that employs practical modulation.
